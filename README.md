# Friendâ€¢Finder App

This project was the homework for week 13 of the Penn Coding Boot Camp.

## Goal
To create a full-stack application using NodeJS, ExpressJS and Heroku (for deployment).

## Installation and Set-up
Make sure to run *npm install* at the root directory after cloning the project. Then in the command line, run either `node server.js` or `npm start`, and direct your browser to `localhost:3000`.
You can also use the deployed version of this app at: https://thawing-depths-35748.herokuapp.com/.

## Functionality
This application starts on the landing page where the user is prompted to "Go to the Survey." Once the user clicks on this button, they will be sent to the Survey page where they will input their name and a link to a picture of them and then they answer 10 questions about their own personality. Once they sumbit the survey a modal will pop up with the name and picture of the person who is most compatible with their own personality.
